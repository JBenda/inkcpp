// Heaven’s Vault is a bit different from our previous game, in that it uses ink - our narrative scripting language - to simulate what a “normal” adventure game would do, with rooms full of interactive props.
// For any ink devs out there, here’s roughly how we’re doing it.
// Each “room” is a knot. Inside the knot, we use threads for each of the props the player can interact with, so we can divide up the action into chunks of interactivity. In each thread, there’s a link back to the top of the location.
// The great thing about this structure it’s very portable - if you have “background” objects that appear in multiple rooms, you simply thread them in and pass a parameter for where to return to. 
// And if you have things that can happen in the room - say, a bit of dialogue for when you stand in a certain place - you can put that in the main “hub” of the location and it’ll always be tested for.
// Heaven’s Vault gets a bit more complicated than this - because we also handle conversation, which can happen anywhere, at any time, from a separate contextual system. But that’s for another post maybe.
